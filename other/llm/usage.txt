Can you help me proofread my writing?

Questionnaire or survey is one of the most common data collection method in terms of statistical research study. Sometimes, in order to detect possible patterns, errors, and biases, a research study collect responses from their participants more than once. One of the common challenges researchers usually encounter is the non-response rate. As I and my group members for Assignment 2 detected when we are trying to replicating the research paper by @feldman, we found a high portion of the responses to be null when Feldman and their colleagues collected the responses at the second time period (@fig-decline-response). This indicates a relatively high non-response rate.

To connect with the nonresponse rate aspect of the editorial “Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments” [@OxfordAcademic] with Feldman and their colleagues’ paper [@feldman], the statistical programming language `R` [@citeR] with libraries `tidyverse` [@tidyverse], `dplyr` [@dplyr], `knitr` [@knitr], and `ggplot2` [@ggplot2] are used for the purpose of this short writing.

According to @Williams_Brick_2018, response rates are falling across all modes of data collection overall. Response rates to web modes, from the study, are lower than that for other modes of data collection. The paper also suggest that this trend will be likely continue through 2022 and beyond. Since, the data set for Study 2 of @feldman is collected by using online survey for workers, the trend we detected in terms of the decrease in response rate at the second round of response collection could be explained by the fact that the response rates declining, especially online, for the recent years.

Questionnaires or surveys are among the most common methods of data collection in statistical research studies. Sometimes, in order to detect possible patterns, errors, and biases, researchers collect responses from participants more than once. One of the common challenges researchers usually encounter is the non-response rate. As my group members and I discovered during Assignment 2, when attempting to replicate the research paper by Feldman et al., we found a high portion of responses to be null during the second data collection period (see Figure 1). This indicates a relatively high non-response rate.

To connect the non-response rate aspect of the editorial "Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments" (Oxford Academic) with Feldman et al.'s paper, we utilized the statistical programming language R, along with libraries such as tidyverse, dplyr, knitr, and ggplot2.

According to Williams and Brick (2018), response rates are declining across all modes of data collection. Response rates for web modes, as reported in the study, are lower than those for other modes of data collection. The paper also suggests that this trend is likely to continue through 2022 and beyond. Since the dataset for Study 2 by Feldman et al. was collected using an online survey for workers, the trend we detected regarding the decrease in response rate during the second round of data collection could be explained by the overall decline in response rates, particularly online, in recent years.

In conclusion, I made a connection between the data trend in survey response rate decline in Feldman et al.'s paper [@feldman] to the low non-response rate and nonresponse bias mentioned in editorial "Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments" [@OxfordAcademic]. This editorial provides aspects that could possibly explain the trend we found when summarizing the responses Feldman and their colleagues collected during two time waves. This connection could serve as a foundation for future research studies in regarding the systematic difference between the respondents and non-respondents to see if that difference could impact the job satisfaction

In conclusion, I have connected the trend of declining survey response rates observed in Feldman et al.'s paper to the issues of low non-response rates and nonresponse bias discussed in the editorial "Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments" (Oxford Academic). This editorial sheds light on aspects that could potentially explain the trend observed when analyzing the responses collected by Feldman and their colleagues during two time waves. This connection establishes a basis for future research endeavors aimed at exploring the systematic differences between respondents and non-respondents to determine if such distinctions could influence job satisfaction.
